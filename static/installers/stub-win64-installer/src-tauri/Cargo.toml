[lib]
# The `_lib` suffix may seem redundant but it is necessary
# to make the lib name unique and wouldn't conflict with the bin name.
# This seems to be only an issue on Windows, see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8519

[build-dependencies]
# loosen exact pin so Cargo can select a tauri-build 2.x compatible with
# the resolved tauri-utils (e.g. 2.8.0). Previously this was pinned to =2.1.0
# which caused an API incompatibility when tauri-utils was resolved to 2.8.0.
